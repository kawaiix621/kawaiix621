**Kawaii Resume**

As an Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) major with a deep passion for Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Quantum Cryptography, and Embedded Systems, I have honed my skills across various technology stacks. My journey includes proficiency in:

**Languages:** Rust, C, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python
**Frameworks:** Node.js, React.js, Qiskit
**Blockchain:** Web3 technologies, consensus protocols like Paxos and Raft
**Systems:** Embedded systems, distributed databases, and state machines
With a strong background in both frontend and backend development, I excel in building fault-tolerant distributed systems and optimizing software performance through continuous iteration and innovation.

**Professional Summary**
I'm currently seeking a Senior Full Stack Engineer position, where I can leverage my technical expertise and leadership skills to build innovative, high-performance solutions. I thrive in environments where I can take projects from concept to completion, drive system architecture, and collaborate closely with stakeholders.

**Key Skills and Qualifications**
5+ years of software engineering experience focused on delivering high-quality, scalable solutions.
Proficiency in frontend development using NextJS (or React), TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.
Backend expertise in TypeScript, Node.js, and frameworks like Express or NestJS.
Extensive experience with SQL databases (Postgres/MySQL).
Deep understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.
Experience with Git/GitHub, including branching methodologies, code review tools, and CI/CD pipelines.
Web3 experience is a major plus (blockchain development and consensus protocols).
Practical experience with BFT consensus mechanisms, gossip protocols, and designing distributed systems.
Hands-on experience with Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure as code tools such as Terraform, Ansible, and Puppet.
Knowledge of DevOps practices, including CI/CD platform setup (GitHub Actions or Jenkins), infrastructure management, and security observability.
Practical experience in scripting for infrastructure deployment (Linux installations, clusters, network setup).
Preferred Skills
Python and Django proficiency.
Experience building high-value fault-tolerant distributed systems.
Strong interest in optimizing consensus mechanisms and network protocols (TCP/UDP).
Knowledge of distributed tracing and debugging in distributed environments.
Understanding of consensus protocols like Paxos and Raft, vector clocks, synchronous vs asynchronous networks.
Contributions to open-source projects and startup experience are a plus.

**What I Bring to the Table**
Resourceful and self-motivated: I excel in environments that require creativity, innovation, and autonomy.
Team-oriented, collaborative, and adaptive: I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can work closely with cross-functional teams and communicate effectively.
Opinionated about software architecture: I am passionate about building systems that prioritize performance, fault-tolerance, and scalability.
Motivated to push system performance: Through continuous optimization, I work to improve the performance of both software and systems.
Strong background in consensus protocols: Experience with Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) consensus and p2p networking layers.
Experience in distributed environments: Skilled in debugging, tracing, and maintaining distributed systems for high-performance computations.
