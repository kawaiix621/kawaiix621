I'm a Rust developer with a strong focus on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) and blockchain-related projects. Alongside my technical expertise, I'm also a digital artist with a keen eye for design. I excel in UI/UX design using Figma and bring assets to life with Rive animations. Among my proudest achievements are GitFish, a decentrilized and robust version control platform, and Auditpool, an innovative blockchain code auditing framework.
